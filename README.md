# File Explorer Reload

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that reloads the file explorer files list.

It is needed sometimes when you made a bulk file operation (copy / move / delete) outside of `Obsidian` while it is open and some of those changes aren't reflected in the `File Explorer` pane. So you might see in the `File Explorer` some files that don't actually exist in the file system, or the opposite, you might miss some files that actually exist in the file system.

- [Video of the issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-uKULzPNX4).
- Discussion on the [Official Obsidian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/sometimes-changes-made-outside-of-obsidian-are-not-reflected-in-the-files-pane/73451).

The usual workaround for this problem is to close and reopen `Obsidian` or invoke `Reload app without saving` command, but for big vaults such workarounds adds undesired waiting time, which the current plugin is aiming to avoid.

The plugin adds `Reload File Explorer` command, `Reload Folder` and `Reload Folder with Subfolders` context menu items.

Also you can use this plugin's functionality programmatically

```js
await app.plugins.plugins["file-explorer-reload"].reloadDirectory(directoryPath, isRecursive);
```
