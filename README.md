# File Explorer Reload

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that reloads the file explorer files list.

It is needed sometimes when you made a bulk file operation (copy / move / delete) outside of `Obsidian` while it is open and some of those changes aren't reflected in the `File Explorer` pane. So you might see in the `File Explorer` some files that don't actually exist in the file system, or the opposite, you might miss some files that actually exist in the file system.

The usual workaround for this problem is to close and reopen `Obsidian` or invoke `Reload app without saving` command, but for big vaults such workarounds adds undesired waiting time, which the current plugin is aiming to avoid.

## Installation

- `File Explorer Reload` is not available on [the official Community Plugins repository](https://obsidian.md/plugins) yet.
- Beta releases can be installed through [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
